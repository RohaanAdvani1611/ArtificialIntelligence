# AI ASSIGNMENT 2

# Problem Statement:
# In the water jug problem in Artificial Intelligence, we are provided with two jugs:
# one having the capacity to hold 3 gallons of water and the other has the capacity to hold 4 gallons of water.
# There is no other measuring equipment available and the jugs also do not have any kind of marking on them.
# So, the agentâ€™s task here is to fill the 4-gallon jug with 2 gallons of water by using only these two jugs
# and no other material. Initially, both our jugs are empty.
